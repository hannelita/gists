== Our Goal

=== TL;DR

What's Neo4j Doc Manager? It is a tool that enables you to migrate existing documents into MongoDB to a Neo4j graph structure. You just run it in background and the information that is in MongoDB will be imported to a graph.

=== A little longer explanation

Neo4j is an OLTP graph database which excels at querying data relationships, which is a weakness of other NoSQL and SQL solutions.  We created the Neo4j Doc Manager for the Mongo Connector to allow MongoDB developers to store JSON data in Mongo while querying the relationship between the data using Neo4j.  We call this polyglot persistence - using the database best suited for the type of data and querying your application requires.

MongDB stores data as JSON documents, while Neo4j stores data as graphs.  In order to enable graph-based querying of Mongo data, we need to determine how to map between these two different data structures.  Our initial goal was to implement a default mapping plan, covering the most well-known cases. We wanted to follow convention instead of requiring configuration. We collected some generic Mongo Document structures based on community feedback and structured the mapping based on them. It's important to note that we are opened for further suggestions and improvements.

This project is based upon the link:https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector[Mongo Connector]. It provides a simple protocol to transfer data from MongoDB to another database. While Mongo publishes Doc Manager implementations for other databses, they did not provide an implementation for Neo4j.  You can grab more detailed information about **mongo-connector** into the official link:https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector/wiki[Project Wiki].

The Mongo Connector requires creating a MongoDB link:http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/[replica set]. An **OplogThread** thread then will listen to all CUD actions occurring in MongoDB. The **mongo-connector** provides an interface to collect the events caught by the OplogThread. The communication interface is implemented into a structure called **DocManager**, which can properly receive and handle Mongo documents and information about the database and its collections.

By extending the **DocManager** class, we have created a Configuration that interacts with Neo4j. Some methods are required to be implemented to keep Mongo Connector protocol consistent. The next section describes in detail how **neo4j_doc_manager** handles each of these methods.

Detailed documentation for the *DocManager* superclass and its protocol can be found link:https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/Writing-Your-Own-DocManager[here]

== About Neo4j DocManager

=== Setup

==== Install neo4j-doc-manager

The preferred method of installation is with the pip package manager:

```
pip install neo4j-doc-manager --pre
```

===== Alternate installation

If you experience any issues with pip you may use the following installation method:

First of all, install link:https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector[mongo-connector]. This can be easily done with the following command:

```
pip install mongo-connector
```

Now install **neo4j_doc_manager** by cloning this repository and setting the `PYTHONPATH` to it's local directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j_doc_manager.git
cd neo4j_doc_manager
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

You also must install **py2neo**:

```
pip install py2neo
```

==== Start Neo4j and Mongo

Ensure that you have a Neo4j instance up and running.

If you have authentication enabled for Neo4j, be sure to set **NEO4J_AUTH** environment variable, containing your user and password. 

```
export NEO4J_AUTH=<user>:<password>
```

Ensure that mongo is running a *replica set*. To initiate a replica set start mongo with:

```
mongod --replSet myDevReplSet
```

Then open link:http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/getting-started-with-the-mongo-shell[mongo-shell] and run:

```
rs.initiate()
```

Please refer to link:https://github.com/10gen-labs/mongo-connector/wiki/FAQ[Mongo Connector FAQ] for more information.


==== Start the Neo4j Doc Manager service

To start the service, run the following command:

```
mongo-connector -m localhost:27017 -t http://localhost:7474/db/data -d neo4j_doc_manager
```

* **-m** provides Mongo endpoint
* **-t** provides Neo4j endpoint. Be sure to specify the protocol (http).
* **-d** specifies Neo4j Doc Manager.


=== Methods

==== Constructor

By invoking **Neo4j Doc Manager** initialisation command with proper parameters ( `mongo-connector -m [mongo_url] -t [neo4j_server_url] -d neo4j_doc_manager` ), the **Neo4jDocManager** constructor is called.

Constructor receives the following arguments:
[source, python]
----
(self, url, auto_commit_interval=DEFAULT_COMMIT_INTERVAL,
                 unique_key='_id', chunk_size=DEFAULT_MAX_BULK, **kwargs)

----

**url** corresponds the address where a Neo4j server instance is running.

**unique_key** corresponds to the identifier refers to the unique key that is being used in Mongo. Default value is *_id* .

===== Authentication

If you have authentication enabled for Neo4j, be sure to set **NEO4J_AUTH** environment variable, containing your user and password. 

```
export NEO4J_AUTH=<user>:<password>
```

If authentication is not enabled on Neo4j, no action is required. To disable authentication on Neo4j, go to Neo4j install directory, and then edit __conf/neo4j-server.properties__ :

```
dbms.security.auth_enabled=false
```

==== Upsert

Upsert consists into the method that creates new nodes and relationships given a Mongo Document. The method signature is described as below:
[source, python]
----
upsert(self, doc, namespace, timestamp):
----

Basically we **translate every element of a collection into a new node**. Since the elements can be composite, we have adopted some patterns to properly convert each document into a group of nodes and relationships:

* Each new node will be receive *Document* Label
* Also the document type (the referred collection from the incoming document) will also be inserted as a node label
* Document id will be propagated to the node. That means node will have the same '_id' that Mongo Document has.
* If the document contains the elements below, they will recursively be transformed into new nodes as well
  ** a nested document
  ** an array of documents
* All the other types of data into the document will be translated into node properties.

In terms of relationships, every time we find composite documents, we will stablish a relationship between the root document and the nested document.

To clarify our scenario, let's imagine an empty MongoDB instance.
Let's also consider an empty instance of Neo4j.

===== Simple case

We then run the following statement into *mongo*, to insert a talk into a collection of talks:

[source]
----
db.talks.insert(  { "session": { "title": "12 Years of Spring: An Open Source Journey", "abstract": "Spring emerged as a core open source project in early 2003 and evolved to a broad portfolio of open source projects up until 2015." }, "topics":  ["keynote", "spring"], "room": "Auditorium", "timeslot": "Wed 29th, 09:30-10:30", "speaker": { "name": "Juergen Hoeller", "bio": "Juergen Hoeller is co-founder of the Spring Framework open source project.", "twitter": "https://twitter.com/springjuergen", "picture": "http://www.springio.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/juergen_hoeller-220x220.jpeg" } } );
----

This will insert the following document into Mongo:
[source, json]
----
{
  "session": {
    "title": "12 Years of Spring: An Open Source Journey",
    "abstract": "Spring emerged as a core open source project in early 2003 and evolved to a broad portfolio of open source projects up until 2015."
  },
  "topics":  ["keynote", "spring"], 
  "room": "Auditorium",
  "timeslot": "Wed 29th, 09:30-10:30",
  "speaker": {
    "name": "Juergen Hoeller",
    "bio": "Juergen Hoeller is co-founder of the Spring Framework open source project.",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/springjuergen",
    "picture": "http://www.springio.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/juergen_hoeller-220x220.jpeg"
  }
}
----

This will be reflected as follows into Neo4j:

=== Setup a Graph to show you and your Likes

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (c:Document:talks { "topics": ["keynote", "spring"], "_id": "56299173867791a26a71a3ec", "room": "Auditorium", "timeslot": "Wed 29th, 09:30-10:30" })
RETURN c
----

And render as a graph.

//graph

=== Now query the graph to show all the things you like

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(liked)
RETURN you.name AS who, type(like) AS how, liked.name AS what
----

And render as a table.

//table
